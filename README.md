# Co-Learning Lounge

Welcome to the one-point community-driven encyclopedia for anything in technology.

Forget fancy blogs with just disorganized articles or full-fledged courses with just basics thrown at you every next day, Here content is created and consumed by the community.

Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Automation or anything tech: we breakdown the buzzwords here together as a community where you co-learn, collaborate, mentor or get mentored, innovate and grow.

## Why Co-learning Lounge ?

When every other learning community you join is a place where people spam about themselves, their work, events, what better can you visualise? (The engagement astonishes me the most.)

The major problem with 99% of the online or offline communities is that they donâ€™t really ensure a safe and secure place for elites to share their knowledge and expertise with young and passionate mind. Itâ€™s pretty simple, You donâ€™t feel like home.

## Our Motive towards society ?

We always learn from experience and experienced people. What better place than group of like-minded people? We believe that great community can bring the great content hence **great learning** compared to all expensive or not so expensive full-fledged courses which stick to basics. While every other course is technology specific and only get starts you. Here we completely focus on use case specific project centric approach where you learn from basics to advance.

As most of us canâ€™t afford expensive courses or leave full time job to attend the school. Hence, we want to bring power back to you by creating content through community contribution which is free, self-paced with full-fledged community support.
