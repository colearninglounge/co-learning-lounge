# <div align="center">What is a Teachable Machine?</div>

A Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes training a Machine Learning model fast, easy and accessible to everyone.

In this project, we will be building a Teachable Machine that lets anyone teach their computer to recognize images using their webcam.

We will also use the [Teachable Machine from Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to train a custom Audio Classifier and use it in our projects.

We will look into TensorFlow JS, a JavaScript library developed by Google for training and using Machine Learning models in the browser and use it to create our own Machine Learning model.

We will also learn about p5.js a JavaScript Library for creative coding and ml5.js, a "Machine Learning for web" library built on top of TensorFlow JS.

By the end of the project, we will have built a **Teachable Machine that runs in your browser** and can be hosted on the Internet and an **Audio Classifier that uses a trained model from Teachable Machine**. 

# <div align="center">What will you learn?</div>

* TensorFlow and TensorFlow JS, one of the most popular libraries for Machine Learning.
* High level JavaScript libraries like p5.js and ml5.js which are great for prototyping.
* How Computer Vision works and how you can create a Computer Vision model.
* Leveraging the power of pre-trained state-of-the-art models using Transfer Learning.
* Deploying Deep Learning models on edge(web browser).
* Learn to collaboratively work on an open-source project using version control system(Git)
* This project will enable you to build cool Computer Vision projects in Tensorflow.js.
* Participating in this project will qualify you to join our intermediate and advanced projects on the same technology.

# <div align="center">Requirements</div>

* Basic knowledge of Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Deep Learning. (Hands-on experience in TensorFlow preferred)
* Basic JavaScript and HTML(enough to read and understand HTML code) programming knowledge.
* Familiarity with version control tools. (GitHub)
* Smart enough to find a solution on the internet(Stackoverflow, GitHub issues etc).

# <div align="center">Time requirement</div>

Should be able to spend minimum 2 hours on weekdays and a minimum of 5 hours on weekends

# <div align="center">Suggested reading</div>

* Haven’t tried a Teachable Machine? Check out [one built by Google](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
* If you do not have any knowledge of HTML, try building a basic website from this [tutorial](https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/myfirstsite/myfirstpage.html).
* If you do not have experience with TensorFlow or Machine Learning, check out [Hello World- for Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/hello-world-for-machine-learning-4dc9af0a7430).
* If you are new to Computer Vision and have no idea about Convolutional Neural Networks, go through these articles even just to refresh your memory.
    * [Getting started with Computer Vision](https://towardsdatascience.com/classifying-fashion-apparel-getting-started-with-computer-vision-271aaf1baf0).
    * [Getting started with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/classifying-fashion-apparel-getting-started-with-convolutional-neural-networks-3ae4fc5d9f76).
* [Optional] Go through [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) documentation. We will use only some basic p5.js for building the Audio Classifier. 

# <div align="center">Course Outline</div>

## <div align="center">Phase 1- Creating the web interface using HTML (2 Hours)</div>

We will start the project by first creating the front-end web page interface for the Teachable Classifier.

We will create a basic web page which we can connect with the brain of our project, which we will build in the coming weeks.

## <div align="center">Phase 2- Creating the “brain” with TensorFlow JS and deploying to GitHub(3 Hours)</div>

We will now create the Machine Learning model that powers this project. 

We will start by loading a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network and connect it with the web interface that we have created in the previous step. 

We will then see how we can use the webcam to capture images and perform inference on them using our loaded model in real-time.

We will finally deploy our Teachable Machine on GitHub for the whole World to see.

## <div align="center">Phase 3- Making the Audio Classifier (2 Hours)</div>

We will train an Audio Classifier and use it for our project.

We will use p5.js and ml5.js for loading our pre-trained Classifier.

We will learn how we can prototype for the web faster with the two libraries(p5.js and ml5.js).

## <div align="center">Phase 4- Taking it ahead (3 Hours)</div>

We will look into what we have built so far and make improvements. 

We will look into how we can add new features and improve the projects.

With the basics covered, you would be able to use TensorFlow JS for a wide range of projects and we will look into some of these.

## <div align="center">Furthur Improvements</div>

* Add more teachable models using [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet)
* Improve the UI

# <div align="center">Post-course benefits</div>

- Get your GitHub reviewed by experts.
- Once you have undertaken and completed the project, you will get full-fledged support from our mentors from the community for any technical help, guidance, etc.
