## Recommendation system
Recommender systems are pretty self-explanatory; as the name suggests, they are systems or techniques that recommend or suggest a particular product, service, or entity.

One other definition of a recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of [information filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_filtering_system) system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.They are primarily used in commercial applications.
And one more simplest definition of recommendation is 

“Recommendation systems are systems that help users discover items they may like”


## Why Recommendation System ??
With increasing number of transactions happening over internet and with tremendous number of choices available to users, there is a need to sift and analyze relevant information on users and items. Recommendation systems exploit user preferences and traits to prioritize and recommend items which the users would like.

Recommendations systems are a big value-add for large companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix etc. as they drive significant customer engagement and revenue. Analysts estimate that already 35% of what consumers purchase on Amazon and 75%of what they watch on Netflix come from product recommendations based on recommendation algorithms. Recommendation systems not only exploit users by tempting them to buy more products & services customized to their tastes, but also keep them engaged for a longer time to show them more ads and get more clients.
## Working of Recommender Systems
So how do recommender systems work? Let’s say Amazon wants to show you the top 10 recommendations in Books category. Here Amazon’s recommender system will start with some kind of data about you so as to figure out your individual tastes and interests. It will then merge this data about you with the collective behaviour of everyone else like you to recommend stuff you might like.
