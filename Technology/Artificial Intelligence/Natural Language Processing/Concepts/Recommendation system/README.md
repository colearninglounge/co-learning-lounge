## Recommendation system
Recommender systems are pretty self-explanatory; as the name suggests, they are systems or techniques that recommend or suggest a particular product, service, or entity.
one other definition of a recmmender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.[1][2] They are primarily used in commercial applications.

## Why Recommendation System ??
With increasing number of transactions happening over internet and with tremendous number of choices available to users, there is a need to sift and analyze relevant information on users and items. Recommendation systems exploit user preferences and traits to prioritize and recommend items which the users would like.

Recommendations systems are a big value-add for large companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix etc. as they drive significant customer engagement and revenue. Analysts estimate that already 35% of what consumers purchase on Amazon and 75%of what they watch on Netflix come from product recommendations based on recommendation algorithms. Recommendation systems not only exploit users by tempting them to buy more products & services customized to their tastes, but also keep them engaged for a longer time to show them more ads and get more clients.
