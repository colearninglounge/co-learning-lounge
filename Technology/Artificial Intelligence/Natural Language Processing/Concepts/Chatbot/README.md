### Chatbot

The popularity of live chat applications has been growing over the past few years. Do you know the number of users of messaging apps is skyrocketing? And on an average person spends ~4-5 hours on an app like Whatsapp?

[Gartner Summits](https://www.gartner.com/imagesrv/summits/docs/na/customer-360/C360_2011_brochure_FINAL.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3TjzBCrv2jQUd-15meSI8bhwDNlaqPuvuC9Dk55rbeOHNSDibDVCfCS6Q) projects that more than 85% of customer interactions will be managed without a human by 2020. üò≥ Chatbots are expected to be the number one consumer application of AI over the next five years according to TechEmergence. üòé And as the AI trend keeps rising, chatbots become more a must-have rather than a nice to have part of the business. The increasing demand for chats continues to grow so to keep the customer satisfaction rate high; companies must find ways to cope with the rising volumes of inquiries coming every day to all their communication channels.

Chatbots have no competition when it comes to turnout and motivation. They never get tired, bored or distracted.

Google 2018 I/O heated up the topic showing their Duplex AI-powered assistant that smoothly managed to book a table, and schedule appointments speaking with humans. The presentation blew everyone‚Äôs mind!

The awesomeness about **Co-learning lounge** is we explore everything in detail üòç Here also we will go from project selection, design/documentation, development to deployment of the bot.

### Project selection  
This definition however often leads to two potential misconceptions.
The biggest misconception that arises is that a chatbot is a bot that converses with a human in the way that another human would converse with a human. Software or even a robot (the digital part of the robot is of course software) that communicates with a human in natural language is not difficult to imagine. Science fiction is full of examples.

While this may be the end goal, this is simply not possible using the current technology. Not only is it not possible, it often leads to unrealistic expectations regarding the chatbot's capabilities and inevitable frustrations when those expectations are not met.

The second misconception is that a chatbot communicates using only text or voice. Actually, chatbots allow users to interact with them via graphical interfaces or graphical widgets, and the trend is in this direction. Many chat platforms including WeChat, Facebook Messenger and Kik allow web views on which developers can create completely customized graphical interfaces.

Chatbots can be used in many different ways, which is the reason why it‚Äôs difficult to define exactly what they are. It is actually possible to come up with a chatbot use case for every single business or industry, in the same way, that every business or industry can use a website or app.	
Literally any task you can do delegate to Chatbot. A couple of things you can definitely do is training chatbot to handle FAQs, Basic flow handling where it can help the user to view,  purchase, or track something, feedback collection or notification. 

All the above examples of chatbots could allow human agents to get involved in the conversation if necessary, perhaps as a premium service.

### Documentation/Design

Detailed conversation design based on a defined scope is the first thing you should do before you head to development. If you are completely new to it and don‚Äôt know where to start then we recommend this article: [How to design a robust chatbot interaction](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-design-a-robust-chatbot-interaction-8bb6dfae34fb?gi=b521852a15a6)
