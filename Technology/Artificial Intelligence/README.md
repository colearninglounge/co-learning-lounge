## Interactive Tools 


### Distill: Exploring Neural Networks with Activation Atlases

Feature inversion to visualize millions of activations from an image classification network leads to an explorable activation atlas of features the network has learned. This can reveal how the network typically represents some concepts.

### Initializing neural networks

Initialization can have a significant impact on convergence in training deep neural networks. Simple initialization schemes can accelerate training, but they require care to avoid common pitfalls. In this post, deeplearning.ai folks explain how to initialize neural network parameters effectively.

### Write a Neural Network from scratch in NumPy

The best way to understand a neural network is to code it up from scratch!

 ## AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

![AI vs ML vs DL](../../images/aivsml.jpg)

## What is Deep Learning ?

Just like we use our brains to identify patterns and classify various types of information, deep learning algorithms can be taught to accomplish the same tasks for machines.

   Example:
   Automatic car driving system is a good example of deep learning.

- Why Deep Learning now?

  Deep learning exits from 1970 but it became popular in the last 5 years due to the following reasons.
    - More availability of Data 
    - Cheaper storage devices
    - More computational power availability
    - More optimized algorithms which takes less power and utilizes less resources.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of AI and these are the algorithms which can learn by themselves without being externally programmed.

Example:
Amazon using machine learning to give better product choice recommendations to there costumers based on their preferences.
Netflix uses machine learning to give better suggestions to their users of the Tv series or movie or shows that they would like to watch.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is a ability of computer program to function like a human brain

Example: Robots like Sophia
