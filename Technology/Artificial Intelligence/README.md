## AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

![AI vs ML vs DL](../../images/aivsml.jpg)

## What is Deep Learning ?

Just like we use our brains to identify patterns and classify various types of information, deep learning algorithms can be taught to accomplish the same tasks for machines.

   Example:
   Automatic car driving system is a good example of deep learning.

- Why Deep Learning now?

  Deep learning exits from 1970 but it became popular in the last 5 years due to the following reasons.
    - More availability of Data 
    - Cheaper storage devices
    - More computational power availability
    - More optimized algorithms which takes less power and utilizes less resources.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of AI and these are the algorithms which can learn by themselves without being externally programmed.

Example:
Amazon using machine learning to give better product choice recommendations to there costumers based on their preferences.
Netflix uses machine learning to give better suggestions to their users of the Tv series or movie or shows that they would like to watch.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is a ability of computer program to function like a human brain

Example: Robots like Sophia
