- What Is Computer Vision?

  Computer vision is a field of study focused on the problem of helping computers to see.

- Challenges of Computer Vision

    - One reason is that we don’t have a strong grasp of how human vision works.
    - Studying biological vision requires an understanding of the perception organs like the eyes, as well as the                 interpretation of the perception within the brain.
    - A given object may be seen from any direction, in any lighting conditions, with any type of occlusion from other             objects, and so on. A true vision system must be able to “see” in any of an infinite number of scenes and still be           able to extract something meaningful.
    
- Popular Applications
    - Object Classification: What broad category of object is in this photograph?
    - Object Identification: Which type of a given object is in this photograph?
    - Object Verification: Is the object in the photograph?
    - Object Detection: Where are the objects in the photograph?
    - Object Landmark Detection: What are the key points for the object in the photograph?
    - Object Segmentation: What pixels belong to the object in the image?
    - Object Recognition: What objects are in this photograph and where are they?
