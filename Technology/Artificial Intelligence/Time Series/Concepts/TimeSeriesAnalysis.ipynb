    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to analyze and pre-process a time-series dataset, before one can apply any statistical or machine learning modelling on it. We will start by downloading a time-series dataset. Then we will pre-process it to make sure that time series is continuous, equispaced and consistent. Then we will go on to visualize the data. Finally, we will learn the significance of stationarity of time series data, auto correlation and partial auto correlation plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import the libraries\n",
    "Python provides a variety of libraries to ease out the computational challenges of coding and handle time-series data rather easily. Here we import the essential libraries for time-series analysis and visualization.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Pandas </b> : This library provides data structures and oprations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. </li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Datetime </b> : This library has classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. </li>\n",
    "    <li> <b> Matplotlib </b> : It provides data visualization functionality. </li>\n",
    "     <li> <b> Statsmodels </b> : It provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. </li>"
