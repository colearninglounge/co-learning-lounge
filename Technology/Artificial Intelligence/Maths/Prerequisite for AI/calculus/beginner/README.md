# Calculus for Beginners
 
>  **The word Calculus comes from Latin meaning "small pebble used for counting** . Because it is like understanding something by looking at small pieces. Calculus is a division of Mathematics that deals with change and
**It had two variants** :

1. [Differential Calculus]( https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/) : Cuts something into small pieces to find how it changes.

2. [Integral Calculus]( https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/) : Integrates the small pieces together to find how much there is. 

  
*In Machine Learning **Calculus** is used to optimize the algorithms by curtailing the loss value, this is one procedure of it. But there are many other uses, please go through this below article once.*
