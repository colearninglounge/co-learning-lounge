# Statistics and Probability

  

> [Statistics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistics.asp) is a form of mathematical analysis that uses quantified models, representations and synopses for a given set of experimental data or real-life studies. Statistics studies methodologies to gather, review, analyze and draw conclusions from data.  

***The study of Statistics can be categorized into two main branches :***

 *1. [Descriptive Statistics ](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/descriptive-inferential-statistics/) :It's used to summarize and graph the data for a group that you choose. This process allows you to understand that specific set of observations. Descriptive statistics describes a [sample](https://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/sample/).*
 
 *2. [Inferential Statistics](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/descriptive-inferential-statistics/) : It takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn.*

> On the other lateral [Probability](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/probability)  is a branch of mathematics that deals with calculating the likelihood of a given event's occurrence, which is expressed as a number between 1 and 0. An event with a probability of 1 can be considered a certainty.

Itâ€™s a good practice to understand the **statistical** intuition during data analysis , to land up with great conclusions.

- In Machine Learning nearly 25% of space was occupied by  **Statistics and Probability**.
