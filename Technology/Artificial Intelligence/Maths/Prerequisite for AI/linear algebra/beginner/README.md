> Linear Algebra is a part of Mathematics and called as the back bone of Machine Learning, since each and every algorithm was engineered on top of notations with originated formulas.

It’s a good practice to comprehend the mathematical perception in the algorithms.

- In Machine Learning nearly 35% of space was equipped with **Linear Algebra**.
