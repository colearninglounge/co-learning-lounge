  >  [Optimization](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-optimization-theory-Is-it-used-in-machine-learning) is a core part of machine learning. Optimization is how learning algorithms minimize their **loss function**. The loss function represents the difference between predicted and actual values, so machine learning use optimization to minimize this function leading to better ability to make predictions on new data. 
  >
While building models, it's very important to optimize the **algorithms** on the time spent during training and testing, else it might be expensive when the model going to ran in production.

- In Machine Learning nearly 15% of space was occupied by **Optimization Theory**.
