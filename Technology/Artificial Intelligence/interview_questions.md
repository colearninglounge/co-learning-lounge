Artificial Intelligence is today widely used for various applications like computer vision, speech recognition, decision-making, perception, reasoning, cognitive capabilities and so on.

##### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

##### What is Deep learning?
It is a subset of machine learning which is used to create an artificial multi-layer neural network. They have self-learning capability based on previous instances and provides high accuracy.
