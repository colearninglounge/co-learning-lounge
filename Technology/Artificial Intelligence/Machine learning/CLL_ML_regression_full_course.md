</p>

Thanks for showing interest in taking part in our Co-learning activity. We assure you the journey full of learning by solving some problems. To get into the Data Science field, the first and the last thing you need is the portfolio where you have solved a problem using data science. Ask any good Data Scientist and they will tell you the same.

#### <div align="center">“Let’s put theory into practice”</div>
  

In this activity, we will solve old Kaggle problems to enable you to participate in ongoing Kaggle competitions.

#### **Why Old Kaggle problems?**
Kaggle is an amazing Data science community with competition from top companies that has a close to the real dataset, Quality discussion, and Solution. A gold mine of knowledge is already there we just need to dig it :)

# <div align="center">Course Outline</div>

## <div align="center"><ins>Python brush up with ML concepts and libraries [3 hours - optional]</ins></div>

*A brief summary on basic concepts of python syntax, data types and in built data structures such as 
loops, lists, tuples, dictionary, functions.*

<U> Understanding basic Machine Learning concepts : </U>

1. What is machine learning?
2. Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning concept.
3. Bias - Variance trade-off.
4. Overfitting and Underfitting in machine learning.
5. Understanding classification and regression.
6. Brief summary of ‘Scikit learn’.
7. Understanding the problem statement for Kaggle problems.

## <div align="center"><ins>Batch Details</ins></div>

*For enrollment into any batch a one on one discussion session would be scheduled with our team where our team will understand your aspiration for joining this course and your understanding about field of Data Science and Kaggle.*

**In Class**

*Brush up would be done for basic Data Science concept and in class hands-on would be conducted on a dataset. All the models designed here would be on Regression case study.*

**Capstone**

*Whatever would be practiced in class that would be under the guided mentorship but knowledge is built up only when practice is done. In this segment an old kaggle problem which is regression based would be alloted to learners to create and practice their own models and be ready to participate in real time kaggle competetions.*

The whole idea is to mentor and guide you well in your Data Science journey. Like others, we don't want to give you **False hopes** and then fail at making a successful career transition. Also, once you join our course and after finishing you can solve plenty of Kaggle problems with help of close and premium community of Kagglers and guidance from mentors.

## <div align="center"><ins>Problems to be undertaken</ins></div>

**1. [Gemstone Price Prediction (In Class)]**

*The dataset consists of prices and other attributes of around 27000 cubic zirconia gemstones, which is an inexpensive alternative of the diamond. You are hired by the gemstone manufacturing company to predict the price of the stones on the basis of details provided and help distinguish between the higher profitable stones and lower profitable stones by analyzing the dataset so as to have a better profit share.*

**2. [Used Cars Price Prediction(Capstone)](https://www.kaggle.com/colearninglounge/used-cars-price-prediction)**

*Predict the price of an unknown car. Build your own Algo for cars 24 !!. This is real time competition and gives a sneek peak in automobiles and retail domain together. Challeging data in terms of practical approach and multicollinearity in the data.*

## <div align="center"><ins>Exploratory Data Analysis Syllabus (6-7 hours)</ins></div>

*To delve into machine learning, the first step is to identify and analyze our dataset in order to ascertain  different patterns, detect missing values and anomalies and identify different characteristics of our data. In other words, we attempt to understand what the data is trying to tell us.*

<U>Understand the different approaches to implement EDA :</U>

1. Understanding the data.
2. Identifying variables and checking data types.
3. Analyzing the basic metrics of different data types.
4. Univariate Analysis- Non-Graphical.
5. Univariate Analysis-Graphical (VDA).
6. Bivariate Analysis.
7. Pair Plot Analysis
8. Missing value treatment.
9. Outlier treatment.
10. Correlation Analysis.
11. Dimensionality Reduction.
12. Binning
13. Log Transformation
14. Scaling

## <div align="center"><ins>Dataset split- (1 hour)</ins></div>

*It is a common practice in machine learning to split data into training, testing and validation set allowing us to calibrate our model and test it’s performance on unseen data*

<U> Learn the concepts and significance of data splitting in model development : </U>

1. Train
2. Test
3. Validation (different types) 

## <div align="center"><ins>ML Algorithms- Supervised learning- Regression (6-8 hours)</ins></div>

*Understanding the theoretical and mathematical of machine learning algorithms is the crux of developing accurate predictive models for Regression problem. Different machine learning algorithms are suited for different types and distribution of data*

<U> Delve into the intricacies of the mathematics and mechanism of the functioning of these algorithms: </U>

   1. Linear Regression
   2. Decision Tree Regressor
   3. Ridge Regression
   4. Lasso Regression
   5. Support Vector Regressor
   6. Artificial Neural Network Regressor
    
## <div align="center"><ins>Evaluation metrics (1 hours)</ins></div>

*A developed model needs to be evaluated for it’s performance before being actually deployed in real time environment.*

<U> Learn the concepts to measure the performance of model based on several metrics : </U>

1. Mean Square Error
2. Root Mean Square Error
3. Mean Absolute Error
4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error

## <div align="center"><ins>ML Explainability (3-4 hours)</ins></div>

*Towards a better understanding of why machine learning models make the decisions they do, and why it matters*

<U> Learn the concepts to measure the interpretability of the ML models : </U>

2. Algorithimc Generalisation

## <div align="center"><ins>Hyperparameter tuning (2-3 hours)</ins></div>

*Once a machine learning algorithm has been identified, it is imperative to choose an optimal set of parameters to tune the model to better fit the data. Such parameters can’t be learn’t during the training process and thus requires an expertise for model tuning.*

Develop an intuition to streamline the parameter optimization process.
