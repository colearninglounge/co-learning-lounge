</p>

Thanks for showing interest in taking part in our Co-learning activity. We assure you the journey full of learning by solving some problems. To get into the Data Science field, the first and the last thing you need is the portfolio where you have solved a problem using data science. Ask any good Data Scientist and they will tell you the same.

#### <div align="center">“Let’s put theory into practice”</div>
  

In this activity, we will solve old Kaggle problems to enable you to participate in ongoing Kaggle competitions.

#### **Why Old Kaggle problems?**
Kaggle is an amazing Data science community with competition from top companies that has a close to the real dataset, Quality discussion, and Solution. A gold mine of knowledge is already there we just need to dig it :)

# <div align="center">Course Outline</div>

## <div align="center"><ins>Python brush up with ML concepts and libraries [3 hours - optional]</ins></div>

*A brief summary on basic concepts of python syntax, data types and in built data structures such as 
loops, lists, tuples, dictionary, functions.*

<U> Understanding basic Machine Learning concepts : </U>

1. What is machine learning?
2. Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning concept.
3. Bias - Variance trade-off.
4. Overfitting and Underfitting in machine learning.
5. Understanding classification, regression and time series.
6. Brief summary of ‘Scikit learn’.
7. Understanding the problem statement for Kaggle problems.

## <div align="center"><ins>Batch Details</ins></div>

*For enrollment into any batch a one on one discussion session would be scheduled with our team where our team will understand your aspiration for joining this course and your understanding about field of Data Science and Kaggle.*

**In Class**

*Brush up would be done for basic Data Science concept and in class hands-on would be conducted on a dataset. All the models designed here would be on Time Series case study.*

**Capstone**

*Whatever would be practiced in class that would be under the guided mentorship but knowledge is built up only when practice is done. In this segment an old kaggle problem which is tiem series based would be alloted to learners to create and practice their own models and be ready to participate in real time kaggle competetions.*

The whole idea is to mentor and guide you well in your Data Science journey. Like others, we don't want to give you **False hopes** and then fail at making a successful career transition. Also, once you join our course and after finishing you can solve plenty of Kaggle problems with help of close and premium community of Kagglers and guidance from mentors.

## <div align="center"><ins>Problems to be undertaken</ins></div>

**1. [COVID-19 Global Forecasting(In Class)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-5/overview)**

*Living with the virus may be the new normal, but analysing the trends of spread of coronavirus and it’s contagiousness can help mitigate its effects. Analysis and visualization of virus spread data can reveal meaningful trends for various geographical locations. Moreover, statistical and ML modelling of everyday cases and deaths can provide useful insights into the future severity of the viral disease.*

**2. [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy(Capstone)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy)**

*Time-series forecasting encapsulates many different problems, such as weather predictions, stock prediction, sale prediction etc. Where an incorrect weather prediction may have you carrying an umbrella on a sunny day, an incorrect sale prediction may lead to high actual and opportunity losses. The popular M-series kaggle competitions involve the analysis and prediction of sale of various products in the retail giant, Walmart. M5 forecasting challenge uses hierarchy sales data to predict the unit sale of the products.*

## <div align="center"><ins>Exploratory Data Analysis Syllabus (3.5 hours)</ins></div>

*Machine learning is said to be 80% data analysis and 20% model building. It is very important to know and understand the data before one can model or predict it. A part of this comes through domain knowledge, while most of it is revealed by the data analysis and visualization.*

<U>Understand the different approaches to implement EDA :</U>

1. Characteristics of a time-series
2. Libraries - Datetime, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Statsmodel and Scikit-learn
3. Preprocessing time-series data
4. Time-series visualization
5. Independent Variables (or Predictors) and Dependent Variable
6. Univariate and Multivariate time-series
7. Uniformity of time-series : Equispaced and non-redundant
8. Level, trend and seasonality
9. Re-sampling the time-series - Upsampling and Downsampling
10. Time-series Visualization using Matplotlib
11. Outlier treatment
12. Autocorrelation and Partial autocorrelation
13. Correlation between variables for feature selection 
14. One step ahead prediction and multiple step prediction



## <div align="center"><ins>Dataset split- (1 hour)</ins></div>

*It is a common practice in machine learning to split data into training, testing and validation set allowing us to calibrate our model and test it’s performance on unseen data*

<U> Learn the concepts and significance of data splitting in model development : </U>

1. Train
2. Test
3. Validation (different types) 

## <div align="center"><ins>ML Algorithms- Supervised time dependent learning- Time Series (4 hours)</ins></div>

*As and when we get comfortable with the data and have enough insight about it, we can go about modelling it. Modelling is essential, fitting an equation or a set of rules that govern the pattern of time-series, which is usually done by providing a large amount of data to an algorithm so find the said equation, also called, training phase. The accuracy and efficiency of a model is decided based on some performance metric, usually root mean squared error. We can compare 2 similar or different models based on their accuracy.*
<U>  A few popular statistical and machine learning time-series models that we will learn are: </U>

1. Naive Method 
2. ARIMA and its variations 
3. Exponential Smoothing and its variations 
4. Multilayer Perceptron 
5. Long Short Term Memory Model 
6. Handling multiple time-series: Concatenation, Bagging, Transfer Learning for ML models 

    
## <div align="center"><ins>Evaluation metrics and Forecasting (2 hours)</ins></div>

*Model validation for time-series is different from traditional ML problems, since it requires us to train a model once to make time-relevant predictions for a long time. Hence, we will take a detailed look into how a time-series model shall be used to make one-step or multiple step ahead predictions effectively.*

<U> Learn the concepts to measure the performance of model based on several metrics : </U>

1. Mean Square Error
2. Root Mean Square Error
3. Mean Absolute Percentage Error
4. Multiple Step ahead prediction techniques - Recursive, Direct, MIMO

## <div align="center"><ins>ML Explainability (3-4 hours)</ins></div>

*Towards a better understanding of why machine learning models make the decisions they do, and why it matters*

<U> Learn the concepts to measure the interpretability of the ML models : </U>

1. LIME
2. Algorithimc Generalisation
