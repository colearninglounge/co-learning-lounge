Thanks for showing interest in taking part in our Co-learning activity. We assure you the journey full of learning by solving some problems. To get into the Data Science field, the first and the last thing you need is the portfolio where you have solved a problem using data science. Ask any good Data Scientist and they will tell you the same.

#### <div align="center">“Let’s put theory into practice”</div>
  

In this activity, we will solve old Kaggle problems to enable you to participate in ongoing Kaggle competitions.

#### **Why Old Kaggle problems?**
Kaggle is an amazing Data science community with competition from top companies that has a close to the real dataset, Quality discussion, and Solution. A gold mine of knowledge is already there we just need to dig it :)

# <div align="center">Course Outline</div>

## <div align="center"><ins>Python brush up with ML concepts and libraries [3 hours - optional]</ins></div>

*A brief summary on basic concepts of python syntax, data types and in built data structures such as 
loops, lists, tuples, dictionary, functions.*

<U> Understanding basic Machine Learning concepts : </U>

1. What is machine learning?
2. Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning concept.
3. Bias - Variance trade-off.
4. Overfitting and Underfitting in machine learning.
5. Understanding classification and regression.
6. Brief summary of ‘Scikit learn’.
7. Understanding the problem statement for Kaggle problems.

Problems to be undertaken:-


**1. [Titanic dataset (Beginner)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)**

*Titanic is one of the most infamous disaster in recent human history which resulted in the 
death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers. Analysis shows that while some amount of luck was 
involved, some passengers were more likely to survive than others. Train a machine learning 
model to predict what sort of people were likely to survive.*

**2. [Credit card fraud detection (Intermediate)](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)**

*It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card 
transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Make 
your machine learning model learn to detect these anomalous transactions*

**3. [Santander’s Customer Satisfaction (Advanced)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction)**

*From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. 
Unhappy customers don't stick around. Work with hundreds of anonymous features to 
predict if a customer is happy with the transaction.*

## <div align="center"><ins>Exploratory Data Analysis Syllabus- 6-8 hours</ins></div>

*To delve into machine learning, the first step is to identify and analyze our dataset in order to ascertain 
different patterns, detect missing values and anomalies and identify different characteristics of our 
data. In other words, we attempt to understand what the data is trying to tell us.*

<U>Understand the different approaches to implement EDA :</U>

1. Understanding the data.
2. Identifying variables and checking data types.
3. Analyzing the basic metrics of different data types.
4. Univariate Analysis- Non-Graphical.
5. Univariate Analysis-Graphical (VDA).
6. Bivariate Analysis.
7. Variable transformations.
8. Missing value treatment.
9. Outlier treatment.
10. Correlation Analysis.
11. Dimensionality Reduction.

## <div align="center"><ins>Dataset split- 1 hour</ins></div>

*It is a common practice in machine learning to split data into training, testing and validation set 
allowing us to calibrate our model and test it’s performance on unseen data*

<U> Learn the concepts and significance of data splitting in model development : </U>

1. Train
2. Test
3. Validation (different types) 

## <div align="center"><ins>ML Algorithms - 8-10 hours</ins></div>

*Understanding the theoretical and mathematical of machine learning algorithms is the crux of 
developing accurate predictive models. Different machine learning algorithms are suited for different 
types and distribution of data*

<U> Delve into the intricacies of the mathematics and mechanism of the functioning of these algorithms: </U>

1. **Supervised learning**
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - SVM
    - Naive Bayes
    - K means
    - Random Forest
    
    
2. **Unsupervised learning**
    - KNN

## <div align="center"><ins>Evaluation metrics- 3-4 hours</ins></div>

*A developed model needs to be evaluated for it’s performance before being actually deployed 
in real time environment.*

<U> Learn the concepts to measure the performance of model based on several metrics : </U>

1. Confusion Matrix
2. F1 Score
3. Gain and LiftChart
4. AUC - ROC
5. Log Loss
6. Gini Coefficient
7. Root Mean Square Error
8. Cross Validation

## <div align="center"><ins>Hyperparameter tuning</ins></div>

*Once a machine learning algorithm has been identified, it is imperative to choose an optimal set of 
parameters to tune the model to better fit the data. Such parameters can’t be learn’t during the 
training process and thus requires an expertise for model tuning.*

Develop an intuition to streamline the parameter optimization process.
