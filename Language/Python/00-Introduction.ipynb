    "1. Awesome community support! This is something you’d need in your early days. Python 2 was released in late 2000 and has been in use for more than 17 years.\n",
    "2. Plethora of third-party libraries! Though many libraries have provided 3.x support but still a large number of modules work only on 2.x versions. If you plan to use Python for speciﬁc applications like web-development with high reliance on external modules, you might be better off with 2.7.\n",
    "3. Some of the features of 3.x versions have backward compatibility and can work with 2.7 version.<br>Example          Like the print function has been backported from python 3 to versions later than python 2.7\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Python 3.8?**\n",
    "1. Cleaner and faster! Python developers have ﬁxed some inherent glitches and minor drawbacks in order to set a stronger foundation for the future. These might not be very relevant initially, but will matter eventually.\n",
    "2. It is the future! 2.7 is the last release for the 2.x family and eventually everyone has to shift to 3.x versions. Python 3 has released stable versions for past 5 years and will continue the same.\n",
    "> There is no clear winner but I suppose the bottom line is that you should focus on learning Python as a language. Shifting between versions should just be a matter of time. "
